Usage Error: The nearest package directory (/opt/hostedapp/node/root/app) doesn't seem to be part of the project declared in /.

- If / isn't intended to be a project, remove any yarn.lock and/or package.json file there.
- If / is intended to be a project, it might be that you forgot to list opt/hostedapp/node/root/app in its workspace configuration.
- Finally, if / is fine and you intend opt/hostedapp/node/root/app to be treated as a completely separate project (not even a workspace), create an empty yarn.lock file in it.
